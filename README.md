# Overview
This repository contains a part of the source codes used in our research project on the **sequential line search** method (which is a variant of Bayesian optimization). The core algorithm is in the source codes in the "mail" folder. This repository also contains the following three example applications:

- bayesian_optimization_1d_gui: A visual demonstration of the standard Bayesian optimization applied to a one-dimensional test function. 
- bayesian_optimization_2d_gui: A visual demonstration of the standard Bayesian optimization applied to a two-dimensional test function.
- sequential_line_search_2d_gui: A visual demonstration of the sequential line search method applied to a two-dimensional test function.

# Requirements
The source codes have been written for and tested on macOS with x86 architecture only. If you want to use different platforms, you may need to tweak some parts on your own. [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) should be pre-installed for qmake and GUI widgets.
